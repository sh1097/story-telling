        <div class="story" style="text-align: center;">
            <p>
                A <u class="one"><b>null</b></u> was making fun of the <u class="two"><b>null</b></u> one day for being slow.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.
            </p>

            <p>
                <u><b id="yess">null</b></u> replied the <u class="two"><b>null</b></u>. "but i get there <u><b id="rel">null</b></u> than you think. I'll run a race and prove it."
            </p>

            <p>
                The <u class="one"><b>null</b></u> was so much <u><b id="adj">null</b></u> at the idea of running a race with the <u class="two"><b>null</b></u>. but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u><b id="three">null</b></u>, who has
                consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled,"
                <u><b id="quots">null</b></u>".
            </p>
            <p>
                The <u class="one"><b>null</b></u> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <u class="two"><b>null</b></u> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <u class="one"><b>null</b></u>. he went off the course to practise
                <u class="veerb"><b>null</b></u> for <u><b id="number">null</b></u> hours untill the <u class="two"><b>null</b></u> should catch up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <u class="two"><b>null</b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <u class="one"><b>null</b></u> was <u class="veerb"><b>null</b></u>. The <u class="one"><b>null</b></u> was so caught
                up in <u class="veerb"><b>null</b></u>; and when at last he did stop, the <u class="two"><b>null</b></u> was near the goal. The <u class="one"><b>null</b></u> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <u class="two"><b>null</b></u>                in time.
            </p>
